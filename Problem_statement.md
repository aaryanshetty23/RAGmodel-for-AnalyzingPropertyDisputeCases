# Problem Statement: User-Centric RAG Model for Indian Legal Document Analysis

## Context
The Indian legal system encompasses a vast array of statutes, acts, and case laws. Legal professionals and researchers often need to analyze specific legal documents relevant to their current cases or research topics. The ability to quickly extract relevant information and insights from these documents is crucial for effective legal work.

## Problem
Develop a user-centric Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model that allows users to select from pre-loaded legal documents, upload their own documents, and then interact with a QAbot to ask questions and gain insights about the content of these documents.

## Specific Objectives

1. **Pre-loaded Document Library**: Maintain a curated collection of frequently used Indian legal documents (e.g., Transfer of Property Act, Succession Act) in a vector database.

2. **Document Selection Interface**: Provide a user interface that allows users to select which pre-loaded documents to include in their current session and upload additional documents as needed.

3. **Document Upload and Processing**: Implement a system to process and index user-uploaded PDF documents, adding them to the session-specific knowledge base.

4. **Interactive QAbot**: Develop a QAbot interface that allows users to ask questions about the selected and uploaded documents, receiving relevant and accurate responses.

5. **Information Retrieval**: Implement a retrieval system that can quickly and accurately find relevant information from the selected and uploaded documents based on user queries.

6. **Context-Aware Responses**: Generate responses that not only provide relevant information but also consider the context of the user's question and the specific documents they've selected or uploaded.

7. **Legal Analysis**: Offer preliminary legal analysis and insights based on the content of the selected documents and the user's queries.
