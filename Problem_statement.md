# Problem Statement: RAG Model for Indian Property Law Analysis

## Context
The Indian legal system, particularly in the domain of property law, is complex and multifaceted. It involves numerous statutes, case laws, and state-specific regulations. Legal professionals often spend considerable time researching relevant precedents and statutes for property dispute cases, which can be time-consuming and may lead to overlooked relevant information.

## Problem
Develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model that assists legal professionals in efficiently analyzing property dispute cases in India by providing relevant case laws, statutes, and preliminary legal analysis.

## Specific Objectives

1. **Information Retrieval**: The model should accurately retrieve relevant case laws, statutes, and legal principles related to a given property dispute scenario from a comprehensive database of Indian legal documents.

2. **Case Law Analysis**: For any given property dispute scenario, the model should identify and summarize the most pertinent previous court decisions, highlighting the key legal principles established or reinforced in these cases.

3. **Statutory Interpretation**: The model should identify and explain the relevant sections of key property-related acts (e.g., Transfer of Property Act, 1882; Land Acquisition Act, 2013) applicable to the given scenario.

4. **Preliminary Legal Analysis**: Based on the retrieved information, the model should generate a preliminary analysis of how the relevant case laws and statutes might apply to the given property dispute scenario.


## Key Challenges

1. **Data Quality and Comprehensiveness**: Ensure the model's knowledge base includes a wide range of relevant and up-to-date legal documents from various authoritative sources.

2. **Language Processing**: Handle the nuances of legal language, including complex sentence structures and domain-specific terminology.

3. **Legal Reasoning**: Develop the model's capability to not just retrieve information, but to apply legal principles to new scenarios in a logically sound manner.

4. **Accuracy and Reliability**: Ensure the model's outputs are accurate and reliable enough to be genuinely useful to legal professionals, while clearly communicating its limitations.


## Future enhancements
1. **Extend to other types of cases**
