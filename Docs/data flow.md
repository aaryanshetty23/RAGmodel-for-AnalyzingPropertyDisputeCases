# Data Flow in Indian Law RAG Model

## 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

### Sources:
- Supreme Court of India judgments
- High Court judgments (property law cases)
- Indian legal codes and statutes (e.g., Transfer of Property Act, Land Acquisition Act)
- Law commission reports related to property law

### Preprocessing Steps:
a) Clean and standardize text
b) Split documents into smaller chunks (e.g., paragraphs or sections)
c) Extract metadata (e.g., case date, court, judges, key topics)

## 2. Embedding Generation

- Use a pre-trained language model to generate embeddings for each document chunk
- Each embedding is a high-dimensional vector that represents the semantic meaning of the text

## 3. Vector Database Creation

- Store embeddings in a vector database 

## 4. Query Processing

When a user submits a query:
a) Convert the query to an embedding using the same model used for document embedding
b) Perform a similarity search in the vector database
c) Retrieve the top-k most similar chunks

## 5. Retrieval

- Fetch the full text and metadata of the retrieved chunks
- Organize retrieved information based on relevance and type (case law, statutes, etc.)

## 6. Generation

- Construct a prompt combining:
  - The user's original query
  - Relevant retrieved information
  - Instructions for the language model
- Use an LLM generate the response

## 7. Output

Provide the user with:
- Generated analysis or summary
- Citations of relevant cases and statutes
- Links or references to full text of cited documents

## Example Flow:

1. User Query: "Tenant refusing to vacate property in Mumbai after lease expiration. Landlord seeking repossession."

2. Query Embedding: Convert query to vector [0.1, 0.3, -0.2, ...]

3. Vector DB Search: Find similar vectors

4. Retrieval: 
   - Case: "Sharma vs Patel, Bombay High Court, 2019" (similarity: 0.92)
   - Statute: "Maharashtra Rent Control Act, Section 15" (similarity: 0.88)
   - Case: "Landlord Association vs State of Maharashtra, Supreme Court, 2020" (similarity: 0.85)

5. Generation Prompt:
   "Given a case where a tenant is refusing to vacate a property in Mumbai after lease expiration, and the landlord is seeking repossession, provide a legal analysis based on the following information:
   [Insert relevant excerpts from retrieved documents]
   
   Consider the principles established in Sharma vs Patel and Landlord Association vs State of Maharashtra cases, as well as the provisions of the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, Section 15."

6. Generated Output:
   "Based on the given scenario and relevant legal precedents, the landlord has strong grounds for seeking repossession. In the case of Sharma vs Patel (Bombay High Court, 2019), it was established that... [continue with analysis]"

This flow ensures that the generated response is grounded in relevant Indian legal precedents and statutes, providing a more accurate and contextual analysis for the user's specific property law query.
